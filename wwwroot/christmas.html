                    <h4>Luke 2: 1&ndash;20</h4>
                    <p>In those days a decree went out from <span class="script dialog-button" data-dialog-id="augustus-dialog">Emperor Augustus</span> that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. <span class="script dialog-button" data-dialog-id="joseph-dialog">Joseph</span> also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with <span class="script dialog-button" data-dialog-id="mary-dialog">Mary</span>, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</p>
                </div>
                <p>In that region there were <span class="script dialog-button" data-dialog-id="shepherds-dialog">shepherds</span> living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an <span class="script dialog-button" data-dialog-id="angel-dialog">angel</span> of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them,</p>
                <p>“Do not be afraid; for see&mdash;I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,</p>
                <p class="script large">“Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!”</p>
                <p>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.” So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</p>

                    <h4>Matthew 2: 1&ndash;12</h4>
                    <p>In the time of <span class="script dialog-button" data-dialog-id="herod-dialog">King Herod</span>, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, <span class="script dialog-button" data-dialog-id="magi-dialog">wise men</span> from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, “Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.” When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and <span class="script dialog-button" data-dialog-id="jerusalem-dialog">all Jerusalem</span> with him; and calling together all the <span class="script dialog-button" data-dialog-id="priests-dialog">chief priests</span> and <span class="script dialog-button" data-dialog-id="scribes-dialog">scribes</span> of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet:</p>
                    <p class="script large">‘And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;<br>
                    for from you shall come a ruler<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is to shepherd my people Israel.’”</p>
                </div>
                <p>Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.” When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road.</p>

                <p>Joseph was a carpenter by trade. Depending on which historical accounts you believe, some say Joseph was much older than Mary, had been married before, and had several children by his first marriage. In other accounts Joseph and Mary are closer in age and Jesus is their first child.</p>
                <p>Joseph is depicted in nativity scenes as both an older man and a younger man. Most Catholic nativities and teachings depict Joseph as an older man.</p>

                <p>Mary of Nazareth was the mother of Jesus. At the time of Jesus' birth Mary was considered to be a young woman somewhere between the ages of 12 and 16. Mary tells us herself she had not been married before and that she was a virgin when the Angel of the Lord informs her she is pregnant with Jesus. At this time women were married as soon as they could bear children, some as young as 10 or 12 years old. This leads us to believe she was indeed very young.</p>
                <p>Mary was a descendant of the House of David, thus fulfilling the prophesy that the Messiah would come from "David's Royal Line."</p>
                <p>Mary is present throughout the rest of the Gospels and it is assumed she traveled with Jesus and his Disciples. Mary had other children, presumably by Joseph, as brothers of Jesus are mentioned. Mary was also present at the death of Christ.</p>

                <p>Shepherds are featured in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Shepherding was a common career, before being anointed as king, David himself was a shepherd.</p>
                <p>Throughout his life, Jesus was referred to as The Good Shepherd.</p>
                <p>When the Angel of the Lord appeared to these shepherds they would have been working in the fields overnight, watching the sheep to make sure predators did not kill or steal the sheep.</p>
                <p>Sheep would have been their entire livelihood and they would have kept careful watch over them day and night.</p>
                <p>Shepherds were not wealthy people or considered the top of society.</p>

                <p>King Herod, or Herod the Great, was the ruler of Judea but subordinate to the Caesar of the Holy Roman Empire (during Herod's life this was Caesar Augustus). He rose to power because of his father's good favor with Julius Caesar.</p>
                <p>Herod was not Jewish by birth, his ancestor converted to Judaism, he was, in fact, Arabic.</p>
                <p>The Biblical accounts of Herod are most likely folklore as there is a great deal recorded about Herod's life but nothing to authenticate the stories told in the Bible. In fact, almost all of Herod's life was recorded by scribes and biographers. The account of Herod sending his men to kill all baby boys under the age of 2 is most likely false.</p>

                <p>Who were The Wisemen? Sometimes called 'kings' The Wisemen would have been from all over the Middle East. They would have been astronomers and studied the stars. It's possible they were also of substantial wealth and often arrived bringing gifts when a new royal was born. However, there were probably many more than three. The number three comes from the number of gifts given to Jesus &mdash; logically three gifts meant there were three wisemen. However, there were probably many more, possibly even hundreds. And, although they were summoned by Herrod, they would have answered to no authority but their own.</p>

                <p>All of Jerusalem sounds like an exaggeration however, it is probably a very accurate way to describe the time of Jesus' birth. All of Jerusalem, meaning, all those of the Jewish faith, were eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Messiah. They had been displaced from their Promised Land. They were promised a Messiah would come and restore all to them. Any word of a possible Messiah would have come to the people as joyful news. It may not have been joyful news for Herrod, as he would have feared the arrival of a rival king (thus the reason he was seeking out the newborn Jesus. While All of Jerusalem would have waited eagerly to hear more about the birth of Jesus, they also feared Herrod. The people were in a difficult position.</p>
